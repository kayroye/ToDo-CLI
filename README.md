# Python To-Do CLI Tool
This is a simple program that functions as a CLI to-do list utility. It was created to help me learn a bit more about command-line parsing (`argparse`), JSON serialization (`json`), and File I/O.

## How to Run
The program is very minimal in it's current state. You can run it via the command line with:

```bash
python tasks.py "Task Name" [-p high|medium|low]
```
